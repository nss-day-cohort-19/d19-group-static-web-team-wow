<p>Wow! Holdings, Inc., is a lifestyle retail company operates two unique, national brand, Wow! and Wow.com, throughout the United States, Canada and online.</p><br>

<p>Wow! is THE mall destination for entertainment, excitement and fun. For over 65 years we have been offering unique product for the lifestyle of our core 18-24 year old guests, who are high energy, technologically savvy, edgy, demanding, independent and always inspired by humor and irreverence.</p><br>

<p>From the outset, Wow! quickly became an oasis within the mall environment offering our guests an entertaining experience both through its merchandising and product mix, and grew to a national chain by the mid-70’s. In 2003, under new management, Wow! lifted the bar higher and set out to reinvent itself. Remaining true to its roots, the reinvention process remained focused on Wow!'s strong history and commitment to irreverence, humor and fun. The result of this reinvention set Wow! on the path to greatness in a subtle shift from Wow! Gifts to Wow!'s in newly re-designed funky, industrial spaces with an award-winning downtown club look.</p><br>

<p>In addition to the company’s retail presence, Wow!’s has taken the frontline in the battle against cancer by fundraising on behalf of three organizations dealing with cancer issues for young people under 40. Since 2008, Boobies Make Me Smile has collected almost $2mm to support organizations like the Young Survival Coalition, Stupid Cancer and Fxck Cancer – all which work toward prevention, education and support of young people with cancer.</p><br>

<p>Today, Wow! operates over 650 stores throughout the United States, Canada and online, and is proud to be one of the longest running shows in the mall. Strong operating disciplines combined with our unique merchandising formula underpins our continued growth. We are committed to, and focused on, our core mission "Life's a Party—We're Makin' it Fun!"</p><br>
